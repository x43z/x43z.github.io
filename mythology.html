            <h2> Mythology </h2>
            <p>In the vast nothingness, there was only emptiness and silence. But soon, a faint glimmer of light
                appeared in the distance, growing brighter and brighter until it revealed itself to be a massive,
                swirling vortex. As the vortex grew in size, it began to pull in everything around it, until finally
                it consumed itself, leaving behind a dark, chaotic world.</p>

            <p>In this world, there were creatures unlike any seen before. They were twisted and grotesque, with no
                clear purpose or reason for their existence. They roamed the land, searching for meaning in a place
                that offered none.</p>

            <p>One such creature was a being of pure darkness, with eyes that shone like stars and a voice that
                echoed with the sound of a thousand voices. It wandered the land, seeking out others like itself,
                but finding only emptiness and despair.</p>

            <p>As the creature continued its search, it came upon a group of beings huddled together in fear. They
                were small and fragile, with delicate wings and gentle eyes. The creature approached them, curious
                about their existence, but they cowered in fear, not understanding the creature's intentions.</p>

            <p>The creature, feeling a strange sense of pity, reached out to touch one of the beings. But as its
                hand made contact, the being let out a piercing scream and crumbled to dust, leaving the creature to
                contemplate its own existence in a world where even the smallest of beings could not survive.</p>

            <p>In the end, the creature found itself alone once again, wandering the desolate land in search of
                something, anything to give it purpose. But as it looked out into the emptiness, it realized that it
                was doomed to wander forever, trapped in a world of darkness and chaos.</p>

            <p>And so, it continued on its never-ending journey, consumed by a deep and all-encompassing sense of
                nihilism and despair.</p>
